## About

<img src="artworks/screenshot.png" alt="Screen Shot" width="350" />

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to write a web app without a single line of JavaScript code.

### Features

* DOM operations via [`web-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys)
* Use 2D canvas to render the graphics
* Event handling (including timer, mouse events)
* Heap memory accessing
* `Math.random` via [`js-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/js-sys)

Just try the [online demo](https://unixzii.github.io/game-of-life) here.

## Build

Before build the project, make sure you have installed these dependencies:

* Node
* Rust (rustup is recommended)
* [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/)

Note that Webpack is not required by this project, feel free to not install that :)

If you're all set, then:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/unixzii/game-of-life.git
cd game-of-life
make
```

Finally, start a web server and open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
